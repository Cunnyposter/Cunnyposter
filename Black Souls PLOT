Black Souls PLOT TTT
 
Gardens are the homes/worlds of Great Ones. 
Some are fun and adventure oriented (Leaf's Garden: Lost Empire, TCO's Garden: Wonderland) 
Some are comfy (Node's Garden: Winterbell)
Some are just shit (Mabel's Garden: Shatranj) 
 
STORY (WIP)
 
-Author Lewis Caroll raises and teaches a cute girl by the name of Alice Liddell
-Lewis falls in love, wants to marry the cunny 
-Time passes. Lots of time. And Lewis is invited to a party to meet his darling Alice once again
-His Alice is now old as shit. And married. Also has multiple children
-Seething and heartbroken, Lewis runs away from his Alice and begins to pray in despair
 
-Lewis prays for some stupid shit, until a Great One hears his prayer.
 
-TCO arrives. Makes a deal with Lewis Carroll. Takes him to it's Garden, curious and obsessed of his love for the girl named Alice
-TCO begins to unironically LARP as Alice
-falls in love (to the best of her autistic Great One ability) with Lewis 
-Has happy adventures with him and an assortment of characters for possible decades within her Garden
-TCO is unhinged, but not completely insane 
-Falling deeper in it's role as Alice, but more akin to Prickett Alice, not /our/ creepy BS2 TCO Alice
-Black Rabbit/Prayer Master, a denizen of TCO's garden begins to get jealous of the two
 
-Prayer Master prays for some stupid shit, until a Great One hears his prayer 
 
-Piece of shit fairy: Mary Sue arrives; Raised up and corrupted by her whore mother and the Jabberwock LARPer
-Mary sees TCO having fun and being in love with Lewis 
-So with her sadistic autism, Mary kidnaps Lewis (and eventually a bunch of other authors from the real world); And clumps their soul together to form one giant rapist schizophrenic storyteller: GRIMM 
-TCO goes absolute batshit at the lost of it's love
 
-Mary is an asshole
-She kidnaps a bunch of other girls and forces them to become actors in her Garden.(Dorothy, Red, Victoria etc) 
-Makes an entire prototype story for Red Riding Hood (Red Hood's game) where she makes Red's actor fuck dogs, get raped by her grandfather, and then kill her own grandmother
-Tortures five girls in particular, and forces them to become the Demon Princesses of the game; With only Snow White managing to realize it by the end
-Renames the Black Rabbit to Prayer Master, to rub shit in his face for ruining the lives of so many people for his prayer
-Gets her mother, Baphomet to enter her Garden as well via Witch Glinda's summoning ritual 
-Re-writes a bunch of fairy-tales, corrupting each one to be as vile as her
-Then re-arranges her entire Garden to fit the new, grimdark world that she wants to make to honor GRIMM
 
-BS1 story begins, where Mary, now known as Leaf, has her own course of adventures with Lewis, now known as GRIMM. 
 
-During the course of the game, TCO slowly begins making her into Leaf's garden; with her persona Alice (The creepy vanishing one, not the cute doll one that helps you) appearing in certain spots of the world.
-Waiting for a moment to steal back her Lewis, TCO finally gets a chance in Baphomet's ending attempt to leave Leaf's batshit garden
-TCO succeeds and steal everything back, even managing to kidnap Leaf
 
 
 
 
-Finally having her darling Lewis back, a now batshit obsessed TCO recreates her entire garden. 
-Makes everything Alice-oriented. Completely corrupts GRIMM's mind to think of nothing but Alice. 
-Invites a host of other Great Ones to partake in her Alice Garden
-Some stay (Actors for Loli Alice, Imouto Alice, and Mother Alice), some however managed to smell TCO's insanity and just fucked off when they had the chance (Big Sister Alice)
-puts Mary in a prison cell for the entire game, only allowing her to be raped or murdered by GRIMM if he so pleases
-outright deletes characters if they stray from her "script" for too long
-makes Prickett, the sane portion of itself, fuck off to Queensland so it doesn't corrupt it's corruption
